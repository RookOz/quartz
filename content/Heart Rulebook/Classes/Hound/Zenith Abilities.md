EVERLASTING STAND
As you feel your identity slipping away into the gestalt
consciousness of the 33rd, you give everything you have to
protect the people of the City Beneath. When a landmark
you are in is under threat from outside
powers (which is pretty much always true), activate
this ability. You become the original owner of
your badge – it might be an instantaneous process,
it might take several weeks – as you prepare
to defend the landmark.
Once your preparations are complete, you are
subsumed into the Hounds completely. The 33rd
will watch the landmark you designated as safe
indefinitely – nothing short of another zenith
ability will put it in danger.
FULCRUM
Your actions have earned you the ultimate reward –
your name replaces the one marked on your badge, and
you are officially inducted into the 33rd. You are filled
with the hopes and fears of every terrified, desperate
person in the Heart. Until the end of the
current situation, you roll five dice and pick the
highest whenever you make an action. Once the
situation ends, you slope off into the depths of
the Heart to fight metaphysical battles beyond
the understanding of mortals.
INCURSION
You learn a fragment of the terrible truth behind what
happened to the 33rd all those years ago, and understand
why they can never die. At the culmination of a dark
ritual, you smash your badge apart on an altar
made from bones and shell casings, and summon
the last moments of the 33rd to your location. Reality
comes undone; the world is transformed into a
twisted, burning maze of trench and razorwire,
and the 33rd act out their terrified final moments
on whoever they can find.
The landmark you’re in is destroyed, pretty
much everything inside it dies and your mind is
blasted into pieces as you witness the lengths
they went to in order to survive.
