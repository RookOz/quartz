# CONDEMN
You have the authority to declare someone as a wanted criminal. Once per session, when you find evidence of someone’s (or something’s) crimes, you can publicly condemn them. When you or another Hound tracks down a condemned target, roll with mastery.

## MINOR: JUDGE
When you track a condemned target as part of a delve, increase your stress dice size by 1 step.

## MINOR: JURY
You no longer need evidence to condemn a target, but you do need a name, a picture or a first-hand description.

## MINOR: EXECUTIONER
When you attack a condemned target, increase your stress dice size by 1 step.

# FOREWARNED AND FOREARMED
Never get into a fight you can’t win. Once per session, when you have an hour or two to spare in a landmark, you can make preparations for the coming challenges. Pick one of the benefits from the list below.
You and all other characters who choose to take part in preparations gain this benefit until they next enter a landmark:
• Whetstone and Weapon Drill. One piece of Kill equipment gains the [[Tags#BRUTAL|BRUTAL tag]].
• Checked and Triple-Checked. One piece of Delve equipment gains the [[Tags#TRUSTY|TRUSTY tag]].
• Toughen Up. Gain +1 Blood protection.
• One for the Road. Gain +1 Mind protection.
• Creative Acquisitions. Gain +1 Supplies protection.

## MINOR: DOUBLE DUTY
Choose two benefits when using this ability; those who take part gain the benefits of both. You can’t choose the same benefit twice.

## MINOR: ENCAMPMENT
You may now perform this action on a delve; add a D6 bane to the delve’s resistance if you do.

## MINOR: EMERGENCY SUPPLIES
If you have a few minutes to spare, you can give yourself or one ally one of the benefits from the list by consuming a resource worth D6 or higher. This does not count as the per-session use of the ability.

# STARE DOWN
You have a reputation as a terrifying enforcer; just looking at some folk is enough to get them to throw down their weapons. Your gaze functions as a weapon (Kill D6, ranged). It only works when your target can see you and if they have the capacity to be scared of you – so criminals are fair game, but heartsblood predators aren’t. You can use this “weapon” in a haven or other landmark without causing a huge ruckus. Your gaze won’t kill people – it’s disheartening, and if you reduce an opponent’s resistance to 0 with it they surrender, try to bargain their way out or trip and incapacitate themselves whilst fleeing.

## MINOR: LEGENDARY
Your gaze now works on things that shouldn’t be scared of you.

## MINOR: NOSE-TO-NOSE
Your gaze gains the [[Tags#POINT-BLANK|POINT-BLANK tag]].

## MINOR: NO SYMPATHY
Once per situation, your gaze functions as (Mend Mind/Blood D6, Ranged) as you give your allies a disapproving glance that spurs them into action.

# TRENCH-FIGHTER
Your mind is scarred with mud, gore and screams from a century before your birth. When you attack at close range, your attacks gain the [[Tags#PIERCING|PIERCING tag]], even if you’re unarmed.

## MINOR: OVER THE TOP
+2 Blood Protection against ranged attacks.

## MINOR: KEEP SMILING
The first time you suffer Mind stress in a situation, do not roll for fallout.

## MINOR: HOMECOMING
When you enter a location with the Haven domain after a delve, refresh stress according to the size and importance of the location. Three shacks with a campfire is D4; Derelictus is D12.

# UNSTOPPABLE
You are filled with the spirits of those Hounds who have come before you. When you are suffering from ongoing Blood fallout, increase your Kill stress dice size by one step.

## MINOR: LIMPING ONWARD
UNSTOPPABLE also increases your Delve stress dice by one step.

## MINOR: SCARS LIKE MEDALS
Gain +1 Blood protection for each ongoing fallout you have.

## MINOR: ON YOUR FEET
Once per session, downgrade a Major Blood fallout you have to a Minor Blood fallout.
