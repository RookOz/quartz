# CURSE OF THE SKY COURT
These fae spirits of air, long-banished from their birth realm, are in a zealous and perpetual quest for pleasure.
Roll Compel+Occult to cast this spell by drinking strong liquor or taking narcotics and intoning an ancient contract. On a success, all those nearby are compelled to seek immediate pleasure: drink, drugs, dance, wild creation of art, music, general hedonism and miscellaneous frivolity. The alien creatures of the Heart may have an unusual definition of “pleasure” that defies mortal minds.

## MINOR: ECSTASY
When you cast CURSE OF THE SKY COURT, you can focus it on a single target rather than everyone nearby. This individual is overwhelmed with joy, and energised to seek more of it – they find it hard to focus on even immediate dangers. As long as you maintain your concentration on them, their difficulty is reduced to Standard.

## MINOR: A MOMENT ETERNAL
Roll Evade+Occult to cast this spell. On a success, your immediate area is time-shifted. For each hour outside of the area, those in the area experience 4 hours of time passing. While intended to stretch out a perfect moment, this can make time-sensitive tasks easier to attempt.
The barrier that surrounds the area is blurry and indistinct, and if anyone from outside the area intrudes, the spell is broken and time resumes to normal speed.

## MINOR: STEAL THE NIGHT AWAY
Once per session, when you engage in reckless hedonism, refresh D6. If you spend time with someone who fascinates you during the process, refresh D8 instead. These refreshes can be spent to remove fallout as though you were making use of a haunt.

# FIRE OF THE RED KING
You have tasted the dreams of the Red King: his breath as fire, his blood as molten gold. This spell causes your unarmed attacks to gain the [[Tags#RANGED|RANGED tag]] as you conjure flames on the clothing and bodies of those nearby. Each successive unarmed attack you inflict on the same target increases the size of your stress dice against that target by one step until the end of the situation.

## MINOR: WORDS OF FLAME
Your unarmed attacks inflict D6 stress rather than D4.

## MINOR: SUPERHEAT
In melee, your unarmed attacks have the [[Tags#PIERCING|PIERCING tag]].

## MINOR: COIN-GOLD BLOOD
You gain Protection 5 against stress marked due to flame or heat.

# FRENZY OF THE SKY COURT
The Court had their memories stripped away and their brains filled with nothing but air; though all of genius level intelligence, they exist purely in a single, frantic moment.
Roll Evade+Occult to cast this spell. On a success, you are filled with the mercurial energy of the Sky Court, and you gain +1 Protection to all resistances for the remainder of the situation. However, until the spell ends (and you can’t end it early), any actions that require more than a couple of seconds’ attention become Risky.

## MINOR: TEMPORARY PERFECTION
When you cast FRENZY OF THE SKY COURT, you gain access to a skill that you do not possess until the end of the situation.

## MINOR: BRISK CONJURATION
You are able to summon an indiscriminate blast of air in a direction of your choice. This spell functions as a (Kill D4, Spread, Debilitating, One-Shot) weapon.

## MINOR: MADDENING STORM
Roll Compel+Occult to cast this spell. On a success, an area roughly the size of a city block – centred on you – is assailed with stiff winds that stir up debris and howl deafeningly through tunnels and vents, but everything within ten feet of you remains calm. All Sneak and Evade checks in this area are made with mastery, but the inhabitants definitely know something’s going on. This effect lasts until the end of the current situation; if you move outside of the zone of calm at the centre beforehand, the spell ends.

# GREED OF THE RED KING
The Red King’s one desire is wealth; he was so devoted to the pursuit of gold that he dreamed himself a reality of infinite splendour. Roll Discern+Occult to cast the spell. On a success, you determine what a target you can see wants most of all right now. In addition, you can smell money, or anything of particular value.

## MINOR: ONLY THE FINEST
Once per situation, an item you are holding becomes Excellent quality. At the end of the situation, the item is destroyed.

## MINOR: GORGE
Once per situation, when you eat (destroy) a resource with the Haven domain, remove stress from Blood, Mind or Echo equal to half the amount rolled on the resource’s dice.

## MINOR: A KING DEMANDS
Once per session, you can demand that a target holding any item gives you that item, and they must obey.

# KISS OF THE DROWNED QUEEN
You have glimpsed the sunken Court of the Drowned Queen, where she slumbers and awaits the resurgence of her line. With a touch, you can conjure salt water in the lungs of those who oppose you. This spell functions as the following weapon: (Kill D6, Piercing.) If the target is at least shin-deep in water, it inflicts D8 damage.

## MINOR: SLUMBERING ETERNAL
You no longer need to breathe air; no matter the situation, you will not asphyxiate. Once per session, you can also locate a useful source of water – a stream, a pipe, a drain, a reservoir, a waterfall, etc.

## MINOR: BODY OF WATER
You may no longer remove Blood fallout or stress by using haunts. However, once per session, choose one of the following when you spend at least an hour submerged in water: remove all stress from Blood, remove all Minor Blood fallout or downgrade one Major Blood fallout to Minor.

## MINOR: GRACE
You may walk on water as though it were solid ground.

# SANCTUM OF THE STONE CHORUS
They claim, in a hundred voices like the scraping of tectonic plates, that they are the Old Gods, imprisoned in the Heart by upstart deities. Roll Discern+Religion to cast this spell. On a success, you find (or spontaneously create) a path to one of the parasitic temples of the Old Gods, which sucks existence from the world like ticks. When you meditate here, remove D6 stress from Echo; your allies may use the temple in the same way. You may not open more than one path to a temple at any one time. After an hour or so, the path will seal shut – but not without warning, so you’ll have time to leave.

## MINOR:BENEVOLENT
Instead of removing D6 stress from Echo, you or any allies may remove D6 stress from Supplies or Fortune instead.

## MINOR: OMNIPRESENT
When you cast this spell, you access the same temple every time, no matter where you are; it becomes a Fracture. At the GM’s discretion,  Major Mind fallout could result in you losing access to this specific temple, and Minor Mind fallout could see it robbed or otherwise compromised.

## MINOR: BOUNTIFUL
Once per session, when you access the temple, you can locate a nonunique item of D8 value or lower.
