THE HERALD OF THE RED KING
You conjure forth a door to the King of Want, and his
approach is terrible. You can only cast this spell
once, but you do so automatically without needing
to roll. The Red King appears, a writhing
town-sized knot of jealousy and fire and ironhard
scales, and breathes flame so hot that it can
destroy anyone and anything it touches. You can
direct his attack. When you cast the spell, roll
Endure+Occult. On a success, you become the
new Red King, a furious engine of desire, and can
be summoned by other Junk Mages. On a failure,
you are added to his hoard. Either way, there’s no
coming back.
THE HERALD OF THE DROWNED QUEEN
You give the Queen what she wants most of all: subjects.
You can only cast this spell once, but you do so
automatically without needing to roll. The landmark
you’re in is half-submerged in water, and
from the depths in the centre a throne room rises,
bearing the immortal majesty of the Drowned
Queen. This is now her dominion, and you are
her most trusted advisor; the remade landmark
is utterly under your and the Queen’s control. You
have a session or two to get what you need out of
the situation before you are retired as a player
character – driven mad from occult stress, assassinated
by agents of a rival haven, or betrothed to
the Queen to cement the new expansion.
THE HERALD OF THE STONE CHORUS
You throw open the door to the Chorus’ prison; while
they look on in shock, you throw another captive into the
cell. You can only cast this spell once, but you do
so automatically without needing to roll. A
creature or entity you are touching is sealed away
in the Stone Chorus’ prison eternally; you become
part of the mechanism that locks the door, and
cease to exist in any meaningful sense. Nothing
can free the target from its prison short of you,
the door, agreeing to open.
