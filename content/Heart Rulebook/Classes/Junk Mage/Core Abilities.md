RAVENING KNOWLEDGE
You crave the touch of what others call “madness”. The
glimpses of truth that ravage your frail, mortal
mind give you unimaginable power. When your
Mind stress is 4 or higher, roll with mastery when
you attempt to cast a spell.
SACRIFICE
You are willing to sacrifice anything for another hit.
Before you cast a spell from this class, you can opt
to destroy a resource with the Occult domain.
Roll the resource’s dice; the amount rolled is
added to your Protection value against any stress
incurred as a result of casting the spell.
