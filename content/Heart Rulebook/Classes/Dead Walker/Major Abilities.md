# DESCENT
You push through purgatory into the storied lands of thedead. When you are in [[Heart Rulebook/Classes/Dead Walker/Core Abilities#ENTER THE GREY|The Grey]], you may undertake a delve to one of the eight heavens listed in the landmark section. Choose which one you have access to when you take this advance.
The delve will be Risky unless you and your companions dress in ritual garb and make suitable preparations to enter the heaven in question. Returning to the Grey requires another delve, which can be harder or easier than the initial one depending on whether the heaven wants to keep you there.

## MINOR: ESOTERIC CARTOGRAPHER
Choose two additional heavens that you have access to whilst in the Grey.

## MINOR: STEP BETWEEN
You can leave a Heaven and arrive at a completely different landmark than the one you started at. Your exit point must be within the same tier, and it must share a domain with the Heaven that you just visited. If you’ve never visited the landmark before, undertaking the delve is Risky.

## MINOR: ALL DOORS AS ONE
When you use STEP BETWEEN, your destination point can be one tier above or below your current tier.

# ECHOES
You can glimpse the remnants of what has come before. Roll Discern + Domain to witness ghostly recreations of the past in your current location. This will generally show the most interesting or dramatic thing that occured within recent memory.

## MINOR: HIDDEN PASSAGEWAY
Once per delve, when you use ECHOES, it functions as a D8 boon.

## MINOR: FRAGMENTARY RECOLLECTION
When you use ECHOES, you can speak with the echoes of people or other sentient entities present. These echoes are momentary snapshots of psyches, with all the limitations on cognition that such a state entails.

## MINOR: ABSORB MEMORIES
Once per session, when you’re in a location with a domain that you do not possess, activate this power. You have access to that domain until the end of the session.

# INVIDIOUS SPECTRE
Your death has got your back – right up until it can claim you for itself. Your death manifests as poltergeist activity and other supernatural phenomena that distresses and confuses your enemies. 
Any weapon you carry is considered to have the [[Tags#CONDUIT|CONDUIT tag]], and as such, you can mark D4 stress to Mind to roll with mastery when you attack for the remainder of the current situation.

## MINOR: SOOTHE
Once per session, when you mark stress, add 1 to any of your Protection values. This increase remains in place until the end of the session.

## MINOR: GHOULISH GRASP
Once per situation, a weapon you are carrying has the [[Tags#DEBILITATING|DEBILITATING tag]].

## MINOR: ETHEREAL TOUCH
If you mark stress to activate the [[Tags#CONDUIT|CONDUIT tag]] on your weapon, it gains the [[Tags#PIERCING|PIERCING tag]].

# REAPER’S STRIKE
You forsake defence for a single, decisive blow. When you attack an adversary, you can choose to lose your Blood protection for the attack before you roll. If you do so and succeed or partially succeed, add your Blood protection value to the stress inflicted.

## MINOR: INEXORABLE
If the first dice you roll to determine the stress inflicted on an adversary shows 1 or 2, roll an additional dice of the same size and add the result to the stress inflicted.

## MINOR: BLOODIED BUT UNBROKEN
When you have 4 or more stress marked to Blood or are suffering from ongoing Blood fallout, gain +2 Blood Protection.

## MINOR: SCYTHING BLOW 
Once per situation, treat your weapon as though it has the [[Tags#SPREAD|SPREAD tag]] when you inflict stress to an adversary.

# SUDDEN DEATH
Your soul is so poorly attached to your body that you can dive headlong into the Grey without warning. [[Heart Rulebook/Classes/Dead Walker/Core Abilities#ENTER THE GREY|ENTER THE GREY]] no longer takes ten minutes to cast – it is instantaneous. Bringing others along with you when you cast it in this manner makes the action Risky.

## MINOR: LIMINAL
Gain +2 Blood protection after entering the Grey. You can see and interact with people who are in the living world – they appear as indistinct blurs at a distance, but become clearer when nearby. You manifest as a weird, semi-ethereal phantom when you use this ability.

## MINOR: ENTROPY
Your hands become (Kill D8, Dangerous).
When you touch a machine, construction or mechanism and focus, you can cause rust and decay where you touched it. Doing this quickly or under stress (e.g. destroying a bridge before your enemies can cross it all theway) requires a Kill+Technology check.

## MINOR: BLOOD SACRIFICE 
Once per situation, when you inflict stress on an adversary that’s roughly the same size as you in melee combat, you can transport both you and them to the Grey.
