ABSOLUTE STASIS
You use up every ounce of your power to encase a dangerous
foe in crystal. To cast this spell, touch a creature;
you and they are forever bound together, rendered
perfect, inviolable and immobile in glittering,
transparent crystal like a statue.
No-one has yet managed to break one of these
statues. In fact, interacting with the crystal in
any way incurs D10 stress as it spreads instantaneously
from one body to another, binding
another person into the curious tableau.
It is believed that those inside the crystal are still
alive and conscious, but as previously mentioned,
no-one has managed to break one open to find out.
DIMENSIONAL BASTION
You become a conduit to the Hive, and thousands of
glyph-marked bees rush out of your body and clothing
until your physical form is dissolved entirely into the
swarm. The bees quickly spread out to the edges of
the landmark you are occupying and ward it,
building crystalline structures that keep the energies
of the Heart at bay. While the bees endure,
this place will be safe from the uncaring and everchanging
Heart Itself. You aren’t quite dead, but
you definitely aren’t alive either: you persist as a
message passed between the bees, an echo in the
place. Rename the landmark appropriately.
SURRENDER TO CHAOS
Alifetimeofcarvingorderfromdisorder,andstilltheHeart
remains chaotic. You lost before you ever started. You give
in, tragically and catastrophically.
When you cast this spell, everything that is
ordered around you flips to disorder: buildings
collapse, machinery overloads and malfunctions,
disease runs rampant, language breaks
down and fire crackles at the edges of your
vision. You are unmade, inverted; your bees are
destroyed; and the Heart arrives to greedily consume
your essence.
The Heart Itself spontaneously manifests in
your current position. You are killed when this
ability is used – crushed under the weight of
impossible mathematics and ruinous vectors.
Lines and angles no longer fully meet at the seams
as raw nuclear chaos unfolds within you. After a
few seconds of utter nightmare, the manifestation
collapses, lapsing back into its natural state.
