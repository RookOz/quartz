THE HIVE
The sweetlings nest within your body. Some of your
organs are replaced with complex copies made
from wax by industrious bees. They live within you
â€“ a few at first, but as you grow in power, great
swarms. Their curious buzzing aligns your mind
with the Hive. At the beginning of each situation,
clear all Mind stress as incipient madness flows
through you and into the Hive. You can never benefit
from Mind protection or remove stress from
Mind, aside from using this ability.
RELEASE THE SWARM
You send out a swarm of bees, eager to defend you. Gain
access to the following weapon: (Kill D4, Spread,
Ranged).
