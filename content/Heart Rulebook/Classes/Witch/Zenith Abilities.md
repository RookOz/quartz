FINAL FORM
You reach down deep within yourself, inside the singing
of your blood, and unearth your purest state: a nightblack
being of wrath and ruin.Your true form was but a
mere shadow of this. You have complete control
over the landmark you are currently occupying
(or the nearby area, if you’re on a delve) and you
are omniscient and omnipresent within its borders.
You alone chooses who lives and dies inside.
At the end of the situation after you activate
this power, the area you are in is stained forever
with your essence. It counts as one tier deeper
than it was before and changes to become appropriately
strange. You live on as an echo, a mark on
the place; it becomes part of you, and you part of it.
PERFECT RESURRECTION
The communion between flesh and fracture, between the
mortal and the undying, becomes near-perfect. You
can make a perfect copy of someone who has
died, but only once. The copy is absolutely the
same as the original, right down to the soul. The
copy is so good, in fact, that the person can no
longer permanently die.
If they sustain damage that would kill them,
they appear dead, but in fact a new copy is pupating
somewhere in the depths of the Heart. It will
slide out wetly within a lunar month. They get no
say in this, and there is no known way to turn it
off short of destroying the Heart Itself.
Casting this spell takes an hour or so of ritual
chanting and kills you.
THE RED QUEEN
You ascend to dominance over the witches of Hallow. Following
a long period of scheming or a single night
of decisive action, you are now in charge of all the
witches of Hallow. Such a force, when mobilised, is
terrifying to behold: their true forms skitter and
swarm across rooftops and in the shadows. Few can
stand in their path and survive.
After a session or two, the realities of being the
head witch set in – there is a surprising amount
of admin to do, and other witches are always
coming to you with requests for aid. Pretty soon
you’re going to be interred in the Red Vaults
beneath Hallow (as all the leaders of the witches
are) to join the chorus of elders.
