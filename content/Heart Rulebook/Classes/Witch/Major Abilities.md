ASCENDANCY
You know the secret of singing the City Beneath into
different shapes. Roll Compel+Occult to cast this
spell and draw the Heart Itself into the area
around you. The area you’re in gains the Occult
domain, and reacts appropriately: magic circles
blossom on the floor and thrum with dark power,
mist floods the air and so on. This lasts until the
end of your current situation.
• MINOR: BYPASS.The first time you cast this
spell on a delve, it functions as a D6 Boon.
• MINOR: BLOOD CALLS FOR BLOOD. All
weapons used in the area increase their stress
dice by 1 step for both adversaries and player
characters.
• MINOR: REFUGE. Clear D6 Fortune stress on
you or an ally each time you cast this spell.
CRIMSON MIRROR
You bleed onto an upturned mirror, and omens swim
within the crimson. Roll Discern+Occult to cast this
spell before you embark on a delve. On a success,
you see three omens; describe them. You don’t
have to be too specific – in fact, the more vague
you are, the better. These are fated to come up on
the delve. The first time you interact with
whatever you find that relates to each omen, you
roll with mastery.
• MINOR: SHARED VISIONS. Your allies can
also roll with mastery when they interact with
the portentous items.
• MINOR: SCARLET INSIGHT. Once per
session, when you cast this spell, clear D8
stress from Mind or Fortune.

• MINOR: DIRE PORTENTS. Once per session,
re-roll any dice that you or anyone else rolled;
the original roll is a vision you received, and
you shout a warning (or act differently this
time around).
EXSANGUINATE
You pluck a target’s blood out of its mouth and nose,
choking it on its own viscera. This spell functions as
a weapon with the following tags: (Kill D6,
ranged). You can mark stress accrued as a result
of using this spell to Echo.
• MINOR:RETCH. The stress dice increases to D8.
• MINOR: MAESTRO. The weapon gains the
Piercing tag.
• MINOR: AS ABOVE, SO BELOW. You do not
need line of sight to use EXSANGUINATE as
long as you have a sympathetic token connected
to your target (their hair, a figurine in their
shape, a favoured item of theirs, etc.), but you
are still limited to making an attack within the
usual distance of the Range tag.
FAMILIAR
You have developed a special relationship with a creature;
you feed it your blood, and in return it accepts the monstrous
changes of your magic. You are accompanied by
a small creature – no bigger than a dog – that is
cowardly and strange to look at. Describe it.
When you take stress from magical sources
(including your own), you may assign that stress to
your familiar instead of your own resistances. When
you mark 4 total stress to your familiar, it is unavailable
until the start of the next session. It returns
changed; describe what aspect of it has been transformed
by the magical energy coursing through it.
At the start of each session, remove all stress
marked against your familiar.
• MINOR: RESILIENT. You can mark 6 total
stress, instead of 4, before you lose access to
your familiar for the remainder of the session.
• MINOR: HUNGRY. Your familiar functions as
a (D8 Kill, Ranged, Unreliable) item.
• MINOR: CURIOUS. Your familiar functions as
a (D8 Delve, Unreliable) item.
GREAT AND TERRIBLE
You unlock the power of your true form – an awe-inspiring
union of magic and flesh. You are no longer
forced to assume your true form (see TRUE
FORM, above) when you take Major fallout.
When you choose to enter your true form, all
adversaries who can see you take D4 stress.
• MINOR: ENTHRALL. When you enter your
true form, you may mark D4 stress to Echo; all
who see you transform are stunned into
inaction, and you have enough time to make a
single action entirely unopposed.
• MINOR: SACRED OBJECT. Once per session,
when you assume your true form, downgrade
one Blood fallout result you are suffering from
by one step.
• MINOR: UNION. Once per situation, when
you are in your true form and an action you
perform would be considered Risky, treat it as
Standard difficulty instead.
LAIR
You adopt or create a predatory building and claim it as
your own; it still eats people, but it doesn’t eat you. The
building in question is no larger than a small shop
or study. Inside, the shadows crawl and scurry, the
walls creak and whisper and a maddening heartbeat
thuds at the back of your consciousness –
perfect for you, but unsettling for anyone else. Any
non-witch who enters your lair must roll Resist+
Occult and mark D6 stress to Echo on a failure
or D4 stress to Echo on a partial success.
When you are in a landmark, roll Mend+Occult
to summon your lair. On a success, it’s always
been here, as far as anyone knows. Your lair acts
as a bond (p. 98) – if it suffers fallout, it’s either
eaten someone who’ll be missed or been damaged
by suspicious locals.
• MINOR: CALM. Your lair no longer inflicts
stress on non-witches when they enter, unless you wish it to. You can’t pick specific targets –
it’s either active or inactive.
• MINOR: RULE. While in your lair, you roll with
mastery on all actions.
• MINOR: FEED. Once per session, you may
feed a helpless or dead person or animal to
your lair to remove stress from your bond. The
larger the creature, the more stress you remove
from the bond – a cat is D4, a person is D6, and
if you can haul or lure a bear in there it’s D12.
