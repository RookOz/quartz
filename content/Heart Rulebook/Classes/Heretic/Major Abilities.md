# OATH OF COMMUNITY
You are scarred and battered from defending the defenceless,
and you bear a sacred shield adorned with the wisdom
of the Goddesses. Gain +1 Blood protection. When a
nearby ally is attacked and you’re ready to defend
them, their Blood Protection increases by 1.

## MINOR: MARTYR’S BLOOD
Once per session, when a nearby ally takes Major Blood fallout, you both take Minor Blood fallout instead.

## MINOR: MIRACULOUS INTERVENTION
Once per situation, when you would mark stress to Blood but before the GM rolls to determine how much, activate this power. The attack only inflicts D4 stress.

## MINOR: CAST ASUNDER
Once per situation, when an adversary inflicts Blood fallout on you, reduce that adversary’s stress dice by 1 step.

# OATH OF FURY
You are but a vessel for the goddesses three to enact their will on the world through your hand. Roll Endure+Religion to beseech Damnou to lend you Her fury as you adorn yourself with sacred silver symbols. 
On a success, until the end of the session, you gain the Kill skill and your attacks gain the [[Tags#BRUTAL|BRUTAL tag]]. If you already possess the Kill skill, gain a knack relevant to an intended target. At the end of the session, if you have not taken the life of a worthy creature, mark D6 stress to Mind. 
The minor advances below grant access to alternate versions of OATH OF FURY. When you cast it, you can choose any version you can access. If you cast OATH OF FURY an additional time without meeting the requirements listed at the end of the spell, you mark D6 stress to Mind immediately.

## MINOR: AVATAR OF FLAME
When you use OATH OF FURY, you can choose to replace the benefits granted with +2 Blood protection and your attacks gaining the [[Tags#DEBILITATING|DEBILITATING tag]]. At the end of the session, if you have not taken the life of a worthy creature, mark D6 stress to Mind.

## MINOR: AVATAR OF MOONLIGHT
When you use OATH OF FURY, you can choose to replace the benefits granted with +2 Echo protection. In addition, when you use the Mend skill on an ally, instead of removing stress you may remove Minor Blood or Mind fallout on a successful roll. At the end of the session, if you have not removed both Blood and Mind fallout from your allies, mark D6 stress to Mind.

## MINOR: AVATAR OF SHADOWS
When you use OATH OF FURY, you can choose to replace the benefits granted with +2 Fortune protection and your attacks (even melee) gaining the [[Tags#EXTREME RANGE|EXTREME RANGE tag]]. At the end of the session, if you have not taken the life of a worthy creature, mark D6 stress to Mind.

# OATH OF SAGACITY
You have learned one of the secret names of Three-Fold Damnou, and when you speak it aloud your enemies are struck senseless by its power. The name of the Goddess functions as the following weapon: (Kill D6, Spread, Debilitating, Maddening, One-Shot).

## MINOR: FRAGMENT OF LEKOLÉ
The weapon gains the [[Tags#BRUTAL|BRUTAL tag]].

## MINOR: FRAGMENT OF LOMBRÉ
The weapon gains the [[Tags#SMOKE|SMOKE tag]] (it manifests like ink dropped in water) and no longer creates noise – in fact, it dampens all nearby noise.

## MINOR: FRAGMENT OF LIMYÉ
When you use RITE OF SAGACITY, you and all nearby allies remove D4 stress from Blood.

# OATH OF TENACITY
She laid a kiss of stars and secrets upon your forehead, and you are infused with her tremendous determination.
When you succeed at a Risky action, increase the size of the stress dice you inflict by 1 step. When you succeed at a Dangerous action, increase the size of the stress dice you inflict by 2 steps.
You can choose to make an action Risky or Dangerous, even if it’s Standard, to gain access to this benefit.

## MINOR: IMPLACABLE FAITH
When you take stress due to attempting a Risky or Dangerous action, the stress dice is reduced by 1 step.

## MINOR: GLORIOUS RESURGENCE
Once per session, when you succeed at a Risky or Dangerous action, clear all stress marked against your resistances.

## MINOR: ABIDE WITH ME
Once per situation, you may grant the benefits of OATH OF TENACITY to a nearby ally.

# RITE OF VIGILANCE
You look upon the world through the six sacred eyes of the Goddess and see beyond the realm of flesh and stone. 
When you attune your mind to the glory of the Moon Beneath, roll Discern+Religion. On a success, when you close your eyes, you can see the souls of creatures around you in your immediate area. These are visible regardless of physical obstructions.

## MINOR: HUNTER
When an ally acts on the information you give them as a result of this power and attacks the creatures you’ve seen, they roll with mastery on their first attack.

## MINOR: HEART’S SIGHT
When an ally acts on the information you give them as a result of this power and attempts to socialise with the people you’ve seen, they roll with mastery on their first action.

## MINOR: BLESSING
When this ability is active, you can touch an ally and confer the benefits of soul-sight to them as well.

# WHERE’S THE OATH OF GRACE?
The followers of Damnou, in her form as the Moon Beneath or the Moon Above, broadly venerate her through the six Damnic virtues: Tenacity, Sagacity, Fury, Community, Vigilance and Grace. 
You’ll notice that five of these virtues are represented in the major advances for the Heretic, but Grace is missing. Why? No-one’s quite sure.
Some priests believe that Grace is above the other virtues, and that miracles channeling its power are beyond the ken of mortals. Others (dangerously) whisper that it was stolen from her by high elf gods millenia ago, making the drow of today blind and stumbling compared to the past paragons of elegance. Whatever the reason, the divine magic of grace evades the priesthood of the Moon Beneath for now.
