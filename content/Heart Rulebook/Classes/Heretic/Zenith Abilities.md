You transcend the need for mortal flesh. The Goddess
appears before you in her trifold majesty: a scintillating
blaze of divinity, silver-crimson and
midnight black. She blesses you, and your frail
mortal anatomy becomes a conduit for her
eternal flesh. You take on an angelic form.
The descriptions of angels of the Moon
Beneath are varied, but multiple heads, six or
more wings, mighty voices raised in exaltation
and an abundance of eyes are common themes.
In your new form, your many hyperdimensional
claws and appendages inflict D10 damage and
possess the Piercing tag. You roll 6D10 when
striking at those who would threaten the faithful
or desecrate sacred ground, and all other actions
automatically fail.
At the end of the situation, you are transfused
into ossified bone-crystal, your radiance added
to her incomprehensible refulgence, and retired
as a player character.
GLORY
You come face to face with the goddess herself, and the
radiance reflected in your eyes is too much for people to
behold. You keep your face covered. When you
uncover it, all those who can see you are stunned
and awed, unable to look upon you without falling
to their knees. Those who remain in your presence
miraculously remove one Minor Blood or Mind
fallout result, or downgrade a Major to a Minor
after about an hour; most NPCs will convert to
your faith on the spot.
In the City Above, a team of aelfir hunters
working for the Solar Church are mobilised and
dispatched to kill you. They will find and eliminate
you, and you will die.
TESTAMENT OF FAITH
You become a beacon of hope for those struck by fear or
desperation. To activate this ability, die a martyr’s
death. The ground on which you died (or where
you’re buried, whichever is more dramatically
appropriate) becomes holy to the church of the
Moon Beneath. Over the next few months, pilgrims
will visit the site and erect a suitable
shrine. For the remainder of the campaign, and
at the GM’s discretion any future campaigns, the
shrine functions as a landmark with some appropriate
haunts. Once per campaign, when the surviving
player characters visit it, they can beseech
your spirit to answer a question. You will deliver
valuable wisdom.
