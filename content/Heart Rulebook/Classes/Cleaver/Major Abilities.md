# BLOODBOUND BEAST
You are accompanied by a ragged cryptid that follows your commands – an ancient stone-browed stag, a razortoothed heartsblood hound or something stranger. You feed it your blood, and it fights for you. You gain the Bloodbound tag on all weapons as you and your companion work in concert.

## MINOR: PACK HUNTER
If you mark stress to Blood to activate the Bloodbound tag, roll with mastery when you use the Delve and Hunt skills for the remainder of the current situation.

## MINOR: POUNCE
Once per situation, select an adversary you can see. That adversary marks D6 stress as your companion leaps on them.

## MINOR: FAITHFUL UNTIL THE END
If you take Critical fallout and would die, you do not die – instead, you are rescued by your companion and dragged to safety at the nearest landmark. Your companion dies in your arms, exhausted and wounded, after you regain consciousness. Remove BLOODBOUND BEAST from your character sheet and gain an immediate major advance. You can’t access BLOODBOUND BEAST ever again.

# CHIMERIC STRAIN
With the sound of cracking muscle and twisting tendon, your form is transmuted into something terrifying. When you activate this power, mark D4 stress to Echo. For the remainder of the current situation, all melee attacks you make gain the Brutal and Wyrd tags.

## MINOR: BLIGHTED
When you activate CHIMERIC STRAIN, increase the Echo stress inflicted by 1 step and gain +2 Blood Protection until the end of the current situation in addition to any other effects.

## MINOR: HORNED 
When you activate CHIMERIC STRAIN, increase the Echo stress inflicted by 1 step and increase your melee damage by 1 step until the end of the current situation, in addition to any other effects.

## MINOR: BEZERK 
When you activate CHIMERIC STRAIN, increase the Echo stress inflicted by 1 step and ignore the effects of Blood fallout until the end of the situation. You fight on, heedless of the pain.

# EXTINCTION BOW
You carry a huge bow capable of launching specially madearrows at your prey – the mark of a true heartsblooded hunter. When you take this ability, you gain access to (or build) an enormous ranged weapon with the following profile: (Kill D10, Tiring, Ranged, Expensive.)

## MINOR: HARPOON
Once per situation, when you inflict stress to an adversary with the EXTINCTION BOW, you attach yourself to them with a rope or chain. They can’t flee while attached – and neither can you.

## MINOR: HUNTER’S EYE 
Once per situation, when you and your allies are in danger, point out a tactically useful element of the landscape. The first time an ally interacts with the element, they roll with mastery on their subsequent action.

## MINOR: NIGHTMARE ARROW
Gain access to the following weapon: (Kill D8, Spread, Ranged, One-Shot). 

# MONSTROUS APPETITE
When you eat, you unhinge your jaw and wolf down anything within reach until your belly is distended and you are resplendent with power. When you use [[Heart Rulebook/Classes/Cleaver/Core Abilities#THE RED FEAST|THE RED FEAST]] to consume a resource that has a domain you can access, remove stress from Blood or Echo equal to the amount rolled on the dice instead.

## MINOR: REJUVENATION 
Once per session, when you use MONSTROUS APPETITE to consume a resource that has a domain that you have access to – and the resource has a value of D8 or higher – you can remove a Minor Blood or Echo fallout entirely.

## MINOR: TAINTED MEAT
Once per session, when you use MONSTROUS APPETITE to consume a resource with the Cursed domain with a value of D8 or higher, add 1 to the minimum protection provided by your [[Heart Rulebook/Classes/Cleaver/Core Abilities#HEARTSBLOOD|HEARTSBLOOD]] core ability instead of removing stress. This effect lasts until the end of the situation.

## MINOR: HORRENDOUS BITE
Once per situation, when you inflict stress with an unarmed attack on an adversary, you may choose to lower their difficulty by one step to a minimum of Standard until the end of the situation.

# THE WILD HUNT
The Heart sings of flesh and plenty; you echo that sickening song. You may lead a group in communion with the Heart. This requires you to pass an Endure+ Cursed roll, and the check is Risky if you’re in an area with the Haven tag. (If you fail the check, you can try again later this session.) 
Those who commune gain the Hunt skill if they don’t already have it, and increase the stress they inflict on delves by 1 step until the end of the current delve.

## MINOR: ECHOES OF THE CITY BENEATH
When you use THE WILD HUNT, instead of the Hunt skill, you may grant the Delve skill to participants. Pick which skill you grant each time you use the ability.

## MINOR: STORYTELLER
Once per session, when you’re tracking a beast, you can declare it to be a renowned beast – you’ve heard tell of it before. Tell the party what’s so dangerous about it, or repeat a legend of its exploits. This increases the beast’s protection by 1, its damage by 1 step and any resources gathered from it by 2 steps.

## MINOR: BOUNTY SHARED
When you complete a delve or hunt and kill a renowned beast (see above), everyone who took part in THE WILD HUNT may remove D6 stress from Fortune or Supplies.
