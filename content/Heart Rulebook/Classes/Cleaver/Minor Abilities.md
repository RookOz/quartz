# CALL OF THE WILD
With an almighty howl or a resounding blast on your horn, you pitch the area around you into disarray. Gain the Wild domain. Once per session, you can summon a chaotic horde of beasts (or just one big one) that throws the area around you into bestial chaos to conceal an escape, make communication nigh-impossible or create a distraction.

# DARKLING EYES
Years of exploring the City Beneath have rid you of the need for creature comforts such as warmth, light and shelter. Gain the Delve skill. Your jet-black eyes allow you to see in pitch blackness as though it were full daylight.

# DESPERATE MEASURES
You’ve eaten people. Sometimes to survive; other times to prosper. Gain the Desolate domain. You can consume the flesh of something or someone that you have recently killed and gain a skill associated with them for the remainder of the situation.

# DOMINION
Gain access to one of the following domains: Cursed, Desolate, Occult, Religion, Wild, Warren. You can take this advance more than once.

# FELL METABOLISM
Food is just fuel to stoke the fire undying within you. Gain the Endure skill. When you use [[Heart Rulebook/Classes/Cleaver/Core Abilities#THE RED FEAST|THE RED FEAST]] ability, you may choose to have your attacks gain the [[Tags#BRUTAL|BRUTAL tag]] for a number of actions equal to the amount rolled on the resource dice instead of gaining a domain.

# FRACTURED FORM
Your flesh glistens with mirror shards that twitch and glitter to blur your silhouette. Gain the Evade skill. Small animals and insects are drawn to you and will perform your bidding to their best of their limited ability.
Once per delve, you may use your adoring swarm as a piece of equipment (Delve D8).

# GUT INSTINCT

# INHUMAN
Gain +1 protection in the Blood, Echo, Fortune or Supplies resistance. You can take this advance more than once.

# PITCHSKIN
Your skin bubbles and shifts into night-black tones as tar seeps through the pores. Gain the Sneak skill. The secretions from your skin are flammable and adhesive, acting as a sort of volatile glue you can exude at will.

# SYMBIOTIC
You place a hand on a wall of flesh and feel the heartbeat of the City Beneath. Gain +2 Fortune protection.

# TWISTING TERRITORY
You’ve fought tooth and nail in tunnels and pits to defend what’s yours. Gain the Warren domain. Once per situation, you can ask the GM who’s in charge of the immediate area around you. By smell, sight or some other esoteric sense, you gain an intuitive understanding of the apex predator or alpha creature (whether that’s a person or a beast) in the local area. 
When you use this power, the target gets the uncanny feeling that they’re under threat.

# UNMAKING CLAWS
Your hands, anointed in the blood of angels, flicker in and out of reality. Gain the Kill skill. Your unarmed attacks gain the [[Tags#PIERCING|PIERCING tag]].

# VESSEL
You let the energies of the Heart wash through you and fill you with glory, rather than struggling against them. Gain +2 Echo protection.
