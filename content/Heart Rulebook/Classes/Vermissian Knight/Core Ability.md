VERMISSIAN PLATE
Your armour is made up of scavenged, barely-understood
technology from the alternate realities inside the
Vermissian network. Once per session, when you
consume a resource with the Technology or
Occult domains by augmenting or repairing your
armour, roll the resource’s dice and choose one of
the following:
• Remove stress marked against Blood, Mind or
Echo equal to the amount rolled.
• Inflict stress on a delve or adversary equal to
the amount rolled.
• (D8 resource or higher) Gain access to a skill or
domain for the rest of the session.
• (D8 resource or higher) Increase your Blood
protection by 1 for the rest of the situation.
