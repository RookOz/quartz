# DRAGON LAKE 
It began when the Great Wyrm, ruler of the vast desert, was slain by the Sultan, and the land transformed. From the sands, Dragon Lake emerged, birthing life into the once barren expanse. The nomadic elvish tribes, once servants of the dragon, now faced a new life by the shores of this mystical lake. As they settled, the first seeds of a new society were sown, with old Arabic nomadic traditions merging with the needs of a sedentary life. This was the dawn of recorded history in a fantastical realm where each day wrote a new page of their emerging story.

# ASPECT GENERATION QUESTIONS

- **From Nomads to Settlers**: We once roamed the desert under the dragon’s watchful eye. Now, we settle by the lake’s nurturing shores. How do we integrate our nomadic heritage into this new sedentary lifestyle?
- **The Sultan's Overreach**: The dragon's curse and the Sultan's demands loom over us. How do we balance the pressure from the empire with our newfound freedom?
- **Free Aspect**: The choice is yours. This aspect allows players to introduce a unique element they believe is important to the development of their community, whether it’s a new challenge, an emerging tradition, or an unforeseen opportunity.

# COMMUNITY QUESTIONS

- **Cultural Integration**: How do the various elvish tribes blend their traditions by the lake’s edge? What new customs have emerged from this union?
- **The Sultan’s Subjects**: Not all embrace the idea of resisting the Sultan's rule. Who are they, and how do their actions affect the community's unity?
- **Resource Management**: With the lake providing fish and water, how has our approach to resource management changed? Who leads these efforts?
- **Rebuilding in a New World**: Ten years have passed since we ceased our wandering. How have we transformed the lakeside to reflect our identity and needs, especially under the constraints of the Sultan's demands?

# AGE TRANSITIONS

- **Entering Age 2**: _The Sultan's Edict_. The Sultan demands the burning of all stories from the God of Story. A knight enforces this decree, threatening our spiritual heritage. Secretly, we hide these texts, defying the Sultan's will. How do we preserve our stories without inviting wrath?
- **Entering Age 3**: _The Knight's Curse_. The knight returns, not only to search for the hidden texts but also to cast a severe curse that prohibits writing in the community's own language. All official records, guides, and important documents must now be written in the Sultan's language, severing a crucial link to the community's cultural heritage. How does the community adapt to these extreme measures? What innovative methods do they develop to preserve their heritage and knowledge without written words?
- **The Legacy**: As isolation ends and external influences grow, our spoken language evolves while written communication is dominated by the Sultan's language. How do our oral traditions adapt, and what legacy do we leave for the future about the resilience of our culture?
