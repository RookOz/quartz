# BACKSTAB
They were fools to have trusted you. When you attack a target who is unaware of your position with a one-handed melee weapon, your attacks gain the [[Tags#PIERCING|PIERCING tag]].

## MINOR: DEAD EYE
The benefit also applies to ranged weapons.

## MINOR: NEVER SAW IT COMING 
Mark D4 stress to Mind to activate this power for your next use of BACKSTAB. Your attack dice increases in size by two steps. NEVER SAW IT COMING only functions against a living person.

## MINOR: REMUNERATION
When you reduce a target to 0 resistance using BACKSTAB, remove stress from Supplies equal to double the value of your current tier.

# BROKER
You beseech Incarne for aid. Roll Mend+Haven to cast this spell. On a success, remove D6 stress from any resistance (other than Supplies) for one nearby character other than yourself.

## MINOR: INVEST
BROKER can now be used on yourself.

## MINOR: TRANSFERRAL
Roll Mend+Haven to cast this spell; on a success, move a Minor fallout from any willing target other than yourself to any other willing target. Both targets must be within arm’s reach of one another, and the receiving party must be able to bear the fallout (i.e. a creature with no legs can’t receive the LIMPING fallout).

## MINOR: INFLICT 
When you cast TRANSFERRAL, the target receiving the fallout does not have to be willing to receive it. Casting the spell in this way uses the target’s difficulty instead of standard difficulty.

# CRAVE
Debt is just quantified want; you cut out the middleman. Roll Compel+Haven to cast this spell on an NPC you’re speaking to; on a success, you can instill a great desire for something in them. If the thing they want is unusual for them, casting this spell is Risky. On a success, they now fiercely want whatever it is you’ve specified until the end of the current situation.

## MINOR: ADDICT
When you cast CRAVE, the target will desire the subject of your choosing until the end of the session. If they don’t get what they want by the end of the session, they either descend into violence to acquire it or lose their mind in despair (GM’s choice).

## MINOR: VIRAL
When you cast CRAVE, the target has the capacity to pass the desire on to anyone they speak to (aside from you) until it fades – there’s a 1 in 6 chance of infection (roll a D6) for every person they talk to for more than a minute. You are immune to the effects of this spell; your allies aren’t.

## MINOR: CONDITIONING
When you cast CRAVE, mark D6 stress to Mind to scar the target with the desire. From now on, the first time they see you each session, treat them as though you had just cast CRAVE on them with the same subject of desire.

# DEBTOR’S REDS
Incarne’s presence thrums through you; you are resplendent, terrible, and hard to look at directly. When you wear the sacred robes of Incarne and a myriad of holy symbols, ledgers and freshly-minted coins, you may automatically cause 1 stress to an adversary who can see you each time you act.

## MINOR: BUY OFF
Once per situation, if you are wearing your Debtor’s Reds and incur stress, you can mark stress to Supplies instead of another resistance. 

## MINOR: CYCLE OF DEBT
Roll Kill+Religion to cast this spell. Target an adversary who has been harmed by DEBTOR’S REDS. They mark stress equal to your current Supplies stress.

## MINOR: ASSUME DEBT
Whilst wearing your Debtor’s Reds, any time you mark Supplies stress you may choose to ignore your Supplies protection. If you do so, you may immediately cause someone within arms reach to mark the same amount of stress that you have just taken.

# KARMIC LEDGER
Once you know what’s keeping someone awake at night, it’s much easier to take advantage of them. Roll Discern+ Haven to cast this spell on a target you can see and hear. On a success, you determine their deepest karmic debt: the greatest thing that they’ve taken from someone else (money, valuables, freedom, a son, etc). When you act on this information, roll with mastery.

## MINOR: CONNECTION
When you cast KARMIC LEDGER, you can see who the debt is owed to via an ephemeral red string connecting the two parties. It’s easy enough to follow it. 

## MINOR: HARVEST 
When you cast KARMIC LEDGER, you can beseech Incarne (ask the GM) to rate the value of their debt on a scale from D4 (low) to D12 (extremely high). When you murder the target and give their debt to Incarne, remove stress equal to the dice size of their debt.

## MINOR: CANDIDATE
Once per session, when you spend a few minutes communing with Incarne, they show you a vision of a person with outstanding karmic debt in your nearby area.

# NETWORK
You draw the faithful – those whose lives have been scarred by debt – around a symbol of Incarne, and harvest the bounty they offer up to your god. When in a landmark with the Haven domain, roll Mend+Religion to cast this spell as you build a shrine to Incarne; on a success, you add the landmark to your trade network.
When you enter a haven that you have added to your trade network, gain a D4 (Haven) resource. Increase the dice size of this resource by one step for every additional haven in the network after the first to a maximum of D10. If you take this ability, you or any other incarnadine may now incur the fallout below.

•FALLOUT: SEVERED. [Major, Fortune/Supplies]
Thanks to your neglect or pure misfortune,
one of your shrines to Incarne has fallen
into disrepair, and the haven it’s inside is no
longer part of your trade network.

# MINOR: PROLIFERATION
Whilst at a haven that’s in your trade network, you and your party may use haunts located in havens that you are not currently visiting. When you use a haunt in this way, halve the value rolled on the dice when determining how much stress to remove from your resistances. If you use such a haunt to remove fallout, increase the cost by 1 step.

# MINOR: PATHWAYS 
When you and your allies attempt to establish a Connection between landmarks and at least one of them is part of your trade network, roll with mastery.

# MINOR: MONEY TALKS
Whilst at a shrine to Incarne, you can communicate with bonds or haunts in any haven that’s part of your trade network.
