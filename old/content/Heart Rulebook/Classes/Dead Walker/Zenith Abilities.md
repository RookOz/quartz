# Extinguish
Your death tells you soft and sweet: you can kill anything you want to. Using your powers over life and death and binding your own energy to the spell, you can draw any person, entity, landmark or concept (aside from the Heart Itself) into a physical vessel. You can then kill the vessel, destroying the concept and yourself in a final strike.
The entity has stats as determined by the GM; you don’t have to fight it alone, and it’s certainly possible (and encouraged) to tip the odds in your favour beforehand. When and if it dies, you die as well. If you kill a landmark, that landmark is destroyed. If you kill a concept, it will wither and die in the minds of the people of the Heart, and they will no longer think of it.
There are limits to what you can achieve with this ability. If you kill the concept of breathable air, for example, folk will still breathe in and out
but they won’t understand what they’re doing or why it’s important.

# INFERNAL CLAWS
You learn the secrets of the Dark Place. You know the location of and the route to hell (or something close to it). You can also summon fallen angels and other agents of misrule to drag a target down there. Compared to hell, the Eight Heavens seem like pretty nice places to spend an eternity. This process traps the target there indefinitely, wracking it with torments and driving it insane. Dragging someone to hell in this way consumes your life essence, and your death embraces you for one final time before stopping your heart.

# SUNDER THE VEIL
With your last breath you tear open a ragged door to heaven and energy floods into the area, causing spontaneous miracles. 
To activate this ability, die.
