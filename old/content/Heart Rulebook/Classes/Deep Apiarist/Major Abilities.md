# ANNIHILATION
Your body is unHeart; it burns through the parasitic world of meat and bone. Against heartsblooded people or creatures, your touch functions as a (Kill D8) weapon. As you use it, your flesh roils and cracks, but the swarm repairs it as quickly as it is unmade; your opponent doesn’t have that luxury. Against any other target, it functions as a (Kill D6) weapon.

## MINOR: BLOSSOM WITHIN THE SKULL
ANNIHILATION gains the [[Tags#RANGED|RANGED tag]].

## MINOR: DARK FLOWERS
Your touch gains the [[Tags#DEBILITATING|DEBILITATING tag]] and causes crystal to coalesce around your targets.

## MINOR: THAT WHICH IS GOLDEN
You may increase the damage die of any weapon you touch by two steps. The weapon is destroyed after it inflicts stress once.

# BLESSED TOXIN
The swarm within you offers up its members as sacrifices to your cause, just like you offer yourself up to the Hive. Some of the bees inside you develop a sting that soothes the mind when injected (as well as being an addictive narcotic).
Your body functions as a (Mend, Mind D6) item; you can mark D4 stress to Blood to have it function as a (Mend, Mind D8) item on your next action.

## MINOR: FEARLESS
Once per session, remove Minor Mind fallout from an ally or allow them to ignore the effects of Major Mind fallout for the remainder of the situation.

## MINOR: PAINLESS
Your body functions as a (Mend, Blood D6) item. You can mark D4 stress to Blood to have it function as a (Mend, Blood D8) item on your next action.

## MINOR:BLOODLESS 
Gain +1 Blood protection. You are immune to mundane poisons.

# DELERIUM SPIKE
The sacred majesty of the Hive fills you with fizzing, unstable power. The stress inflicted by your [[Heart Rulebook/Classes/Deep Apiarist/Core Abilities#RELEASE THE SWARM|RELEASE THE SWARM]] ability increases to D6. The first time you inflict stress using  [[Heart Rulebook/Classes/Deep Apiarist/Core Abilities#RELEASE THE SWARM|RELEASE THE SWARM]] in a situation, add your Mind stress to the stress inflicted on the target. After the action is resolved, reduce your Mind stress to 0.

## MINOR: IMPERFECT BALANCE
When you mark stress to Blood, halve the amount of Blood stress inflicted (rounding up) if it is lower than your current Mind stress.

## MINOR: VENOMOUS HEX
You may replace the [[Tags#SPREAD|SPREAD tag]] with the [[Tags#PIERCING|PIERCING tag]] when you use  [[Heart Rulebook/Classes/Deep Apiarist/Core Abilities#RELEASE THE SWARM|RELEASE THE SWARM]].

## MINOR: INQUISITIVE BURROWERS.
[[Heart Rulebook/Classes/Deep Apiarist/Core Abilities#RELEASE THE SWARM|RELEASE THE SWARM]] gains the [[Tags#BRUTAL|BRUTAL tag]].

# SACRED GEOMETRY
Multiple futures swim about your head, and you pick that which is most advantageous; to an outside observer, you move unopposed and uncanny. When you are rolling to inflict stress on a delve or adversary, or remove stress from yourself or an ally, and you roll a 6 (a number sacred to Apiarists), roll an additional D6 and add it to your total.

## MINOR: MAJESTIC 
Once per situation, when you roll to resolve an action and you roll a 6,
count that dice as if it rolled 10.

## MINOR: PRISTINE
You are always clean and well-presented, even when you have been trudging through filth or battling noxious pitchkin in close quarters.
When you arrive in a landmark after a delve, roll with mastery when you make a first impression.

## MINOR: REGAL
Once per situation, after you mark stress to a resistance, gain +2 Protection in that resistance until the end of the situation.

# UNCHAOS
The Heart is a chaotic place, and you seek to undo that with ancient magic. Roll Mend+Occult to cast this spell. On a success, for the remainder of the situation, you or one nearby ally treats Risky actions as Standard actions (keep the highest rolled dice) as probability coalesces around you and crystallizes at your feet.

## MINOR: STABILISATION 
UNCHAOS may now affect all allies within arm’s reach rather than a single nearby ally. If they leave your side, they lose access to the effect.

## MINOR: PERFECTION
Once per situation, a target under the effect of UNCHAOS can treat a Dangerous action as a Standard action.

## MINOR: FILED AWAY
Once per situation, when you cast UNCHAOS, all those affected bythe spell remove D4 stress from Fortune.
