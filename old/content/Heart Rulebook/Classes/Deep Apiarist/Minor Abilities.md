# A PERFECT MACHINE
You see that cogs, gears and engines are just echoes of the infinite, staggering majesty that is the Hive. Gain the Technology skill. Given time, you can repair technological devices even if you don’t have the right parts: you synthesise them from wax and extruded bone.

# APISAMBULATION
Your body sleeps while your mind, riddled with industrious bees, marches on. Gain access to the Delve skill. Once per session, while on a delve, you can opt to fall asleep and let the bees inside your body steer you. In this state, the bees speak for you and perform actions on your behalf – roleplay accordingly (the GM can use Fortune fallout to represent your inhuman pilots). Assuming you get a few hours’ rest and progress on the delve, refresh D6 from any of your resistances.

# HIVEBORN
You were reborn in one of the Great Hives; your body, though still mortal, is waxen and papery. Gain the Warren domain. You can fit yourself through any gap small enough for a bee by having your swarm chew up and reform your body on the other side. This process takes upwards of six hours. You can rush to get it done in an hour instead, but mark D8 stress to Blood as a result.

# HUNTER OF THE DAMNED
You bring order to the Heart with sword and shot. Gain the Hunt skill. Once per session, when you eliminate a heartsblooded creature, remove D6 stress from any of your resistances.

# INTOXICANT
Pheromone glands pucker and blossom on your wrists and neck; you are alluring, irresistible, almost soporific. Gain the Compel skill. Once per session, when you talk to someone for five minutes or more, you convince them to revert to their basest impulses. They become driven solely by lust, hunger or a need for shelter – whichever they desire most right now.

# INTRUSION
Your swarm grants you the power to overwhelm and control rudimentary minds. Gain the Wild domain. You learn the following spell: send your swarm to occupy and control the body of a wild animal that you can see with a successful Compel+Wild roll. You can now direct the animal to perform basic tasks, but the swarm’s control is imperfect. For the duration of this spell, your unconscious body slumps to the floor; you come to when the swarm returns to you. At the end of the situation, the animal you controlled dies.

# MANY EYES
Each of your companions is a vessel for your sight. Gain the Discern skill. When you stand still and close your eyes, you can see through the eyes of any of your bees, allowing you to spy around corners or look into closed spaces. You can’t control the bees directly, but you have enough at your disposal to cover the area around you.

# PERFECT STRUCTURE
Your body eschews treacherous meat in favour of a sturdy waxen comb. Gain +2 Echo Protection.

# THRICE-WARDED
Your bees are marked with auspicious glyphs and you are able to brave the worst of the Heart unscathed. Gain the Cursed domain. Each session, the first time you would take Minor Fortune fallout, avoid the fallout and do not remove stress from Fortune.

# UNCANNY BIOLOGY
Aside from the Queen nestled inside your heart, every part of your body is replaceable by the swarm. Gain +2 Blood Protection.

# WAXEN SIGILS
Gain +1 Protection in the Blood, Echo, Fortune or Supplies resistance. You can take this advance more than once.

# WHISPERS OF THE HIVE
Gain access to one of the following domains: Cursed, Desolate, Occult, Religion, Technology, Warren, Wild. You can take this advance more than once.

# WISDOM FLOWS SO SWEET
Gain access to one of the following skills: Compel, Delve, Discern, Endure, Hunt, Kill, Mend, Sneak. You can take this advance more than once.
