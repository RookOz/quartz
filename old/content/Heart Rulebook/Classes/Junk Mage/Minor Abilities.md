# BACK POCKET ARCANA
Your satchel is overstuffed with occult leftovers – shavings of spireblack amber here, cursed squid-ink there, nails from wrongful crucifictions – that you can press into service. +2 Supplies Protection.

# BEEN EVERYWHERE
Gain access to one of the following domains: Cursed, Desolate, Haven, Occult, Religion, Technology, Warren. You can take this advance more than once.

# BY ANY MEANS
Gain access to one of the following skills: Compel, Delve, Discern, Evade, Hunt, Kill, Sneak, Mend. You can take this advance more than once.

# FRONTIER ETIQUETTE
Your time in the City Above wasn’t for naught; you learned how to hold a conversation, smile and nod in all the right places and read a room to avoid offence. Gain the Haven domain. The first time each session that you use a haunt, your spent resource counts as one dice size higher.

# LITANIES OF FALSE POWER
You know that the gods of the world are distant, dead or disinterested; but you pay attention, for they may reveal useful secrets. Gain the Religion domain. When you use the [[Heart Rulebook/Classes/Junk Mage/Core Abilities#SACRIFICE|SACRIFICE]] ability above, you may also consume resources with the Religion domain.

# MARK OF HUNGER
You can taste the power slumbering in the City Beneath, and you want it more than anything. Gain the Delve skill. You can smell sources of magical power – the more potent and active, the more pungent the smell.
Different types of magic have different scents: relics of the Moon Beneath have the aroma of wine and butter, necromancy smells like nujabian kafee and the occult technology of the Vermissian resembles malt and rich tannins.

# MARK OF THE PHANTOM
Silver-grey skinspells and litanies of obfuscation wind their way over your body; you are an aberration in space and time, glitching through the City Beneath. 
Gain the Evade skill. Once per situation, when you mark stress due to physical harm or detection, you may make the GM reroll the stress dice. Keep the second result, even if it’s higher.

# MARK OF SHADOW
You conceal your activities from rivals and superstitious fools with a mark etched on your skin; when you speak the right words, you become hard to notice. 
Gain the Sneak skill. Hiding from someone or something is always a Standard action for you, and never Risky or Dangerous.

# MARK OF THE WEAVER
Your hands are covered in spiderweb ink; you have the capacity to stitch, fix and bind with a thought. Gain the Mend skill. Once per session, you can fix someone or something in a matter of seconds, even if it would usually take hours of careful work.

# RUST AND IRON
You know of pathways that are clockwork and galvanic, shifting and malevolent, and were built by no mortal hand. Gain the Technology domain. 
Learn the following spell: roll Mend+Technology to improve a piece of equipment that has moving parts using a ritual that takes around half an hour. On a success, increase the equipment’s quality by 1 step (standard becomes good, good becomes excellent) and give it the [[Tags#DANGEROUS|DANGEROUS tag]] and [[Tags#UNRELIABLE|UNRELIABLE tag]]. Once you have improved a piece of equipment with this spell, you can’t improve it again.

# SIPHON OF FORTUNE
There are places where you can wager more than cash on a game of cards; your stake of choice is good luck. +2 Fortune Protection.

# WARDING SPELLS
Gain +1 Protection in the Blood, Supplies, Echo or Fortune resistance. You can take this advance more than once.

# WRETCHED AND GLORIOUS
Your body is a prison, and when it blurs or breaks, you feel closer to your patrons. Gain the Cursed domain. When you use the [[Heart Rulebook/Classes/Junk Mage/Core Abilities#SACRIFICE|SACRIFICE]]  ability above, you may also consume resources with the Cursed domain.
