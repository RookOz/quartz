# END OF THE LINE
A lifetime of searching has paid off: you discover what you’ve been looking for all these years. On tier 2 or deeper, you may activate this power. 
You learn of the location of a unique landmark – something truly extraordinary. Work out what it is with the GM. You must complete a delve to reach it. Once there, you cannot leave the landmark. Instead, you die in some tragic fashion, vow to protect it forever or ascend into a pure state of electricity and echoing rails. Your character is removed from the story.

# PERPETUAL MOTION ENGINE
Years of heartsblood radiation and forbidden knowledge culminate in your ultimate work: an engine powered by a throbbing heartseed, a source of wild and limitless power. Upon implantation of the heartseed into your suit’s furnace, you become an unstoppable force within the City Beneath – indeed, you can never stop moving.
You stamp off into the darkness, and your character is removed from the story except for the DEUX EX MACHINA ability that is granted to all surviving members of your party.

## DEUS EX MACHINA
This ability may only be used once per campaign by a single player character. When you are outside of a landmark and you or an ally suffers Major or Critical fallout, an inhuman collection of meat and twisted steel – the Vermissian Knight – arrives. They’ve been watching you this whole time. They immediately inflict 25 stress on an adversary of the GM’s choosing, then disappear into the City Beneath to protect other delvers.

# THE LAST TRAIN
You consume your power in a forbidden rite. Etching ancient timetables onto the walls in the blood of angels, and lighting signal-fires in colours not visible to the naked eye, you summon The Last Train to your position.
The Last Train arrives at your current position by the most direct and destructive route, destroying anything in its path. You are killed when this ability is used – crushed under the wheels of the train, riddled with strange energies and cooked in your armour or burned out from the occult strain.
