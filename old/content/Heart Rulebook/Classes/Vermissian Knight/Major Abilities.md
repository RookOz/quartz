# AETHERIC FIELD
Your armour buzzes with static that makes your hair stand on end; this discharge can keep you safe from the body-warping effects of the Vermissian. Once per session, activate this power. You gain +3 Echo protection until the end of the current situation.

## MINOR: HELIXICAN BURST
When you activate AETHERIC FIELD, deal damage equal to your Echo protection to all adversaries standing nearby.

## MINOR: RECHARGE
Once you’ve used AETHERIC FIELD, you can use it again by consuming a D6 or higher value resource with the Occult or Cursed tags.

## MINOR: ANATHEMA
When AETHERIC FIELD is active, your melee attacks against heartsblood creatures or people gain the [[Tags#BRUTAL|BRUTAL tag]].

# DRAGON-KILLER
You have been entrusted with a greatblade from the order’s vaults – an ancient weapon designed to slay the fiercest abominations within the Vermissian network. A greatblade has two profiles: one when used against human-sized targets (Kill D6, [[Tags#TIRING|TIRING tag]]), and one when used against targets significantly larger than yourself (Kill D10, [[Tags#TIRING|TIRING tag]]).

## MINOR: HUNTED
Name the creature that is coming after you. Once per session, you can declare that it replaces the opposition in a dangerous scene as it eats them, chases them off or causes a big distraction – the GM decides. You’ll have to fight or evade it yourself now, of course. If you kill it, gain a minor advance and remove this ability.

## MINOR: ENDURANCE TRAINING
Your greatblade no longer has the [[Tags#TIRING|TIRING tag]], and inflicts D8 stress against human-sized targets.

## MINOR: APPLIED RESEARCH
Once per situation, when you inflict stress on an adversary, you can identify its weak spots. For the remainder of the situation, you treat that adversary’s difficulty as one step lower (to a minimum of Standard) when acting against it.

# GET BEHIND ME
You know that you can’t explore the world alone, so you’ve learned to keep your team alive. Any ally within arm’s reach of you gains +1 Blood protection thanks to your interventions. Once per situation, you can bellow an order and remove D4 Blood or Mind stress from a nearby ally.

## MINOR: LAST-MINUTE INTERVENTION
Once per session, when an ally within arm’s reach of you suffers Blood fallout, immediately downgrade it by one step (or remove it if it’s Minor fallout).

## MINOR: STEAM VENT
Your armour gains the [[Tags#SMOKE|SMOKE tag]], and you can activate it at will.

## MINOR: BACK-TO-BACK
If there’s only one ally within arm’s reach of you, they gain +2 Blood protection instead of +1.

# OVERCLOCK
You push your Vermissian Plate up to, and honestly beyond, its limits. You may activate this ability at any time. When you do, make an immediate melee attack; your weapon gains the [[Tags#BRUTAL|BRUTAL tag]]. After using the ability, mark D4 stress to Fortune as you push your luck and strain your engines.

## MINOR: PUNCTURE
When you activate OVERCLOCK, you may choose to add the [[Tags#PIERCING|PIERCING tag]] to your attacks in addition to the [[Tags#BRUTAL|BRUTAL tag]]. If you do this, mark D6 stress to Fortune after using the ability.

## MINOR: MOMENTUM
When you activate OVERCLOCK, you may choose to add the [[Tags#TRUSTY|TRUSTY tag]] to a Delve roll instead of the [[Tags#BRUTAL|BRUTAL tag]] to an attack.

## MINOR: GALVANIC CRUCIBLE
You may activate your [[Heart Rulebook/Classes/Vermissian Knight/Core Ability|VERMISSIAN PLATE]] core ability twice per session, rather than once. The second time you do it, mark D4 stress to Fortune.

# TRAILBLAZER
Leading teams of explorers to lost sites and distant stations have taught you how best to move through the City Beneath – even at a cost to your own health. When you lead a party on a delve, you may activate this ability.
When active, increase the stress dice inflicted on the delve (and that the delve inflicts on you) by one step.

## MINOR: FIRST TO THE FRONT
When you lead a party in a fight you may activate this ability. When active, increase the stress dice that you and the adversary inflict on each other by one step.

## MINOR: PATHFINDER
When you attempt to establish a connection on a delve, roll with mastery.

## MINOR: KEEP YOUR HEADS DOWN
Whilst on a delve, any ally who can see or hear you while you give orders gains +1 Fortune protection.
